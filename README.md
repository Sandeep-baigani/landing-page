# landing-page
I've successfully completed my project for the Codsoft Internship Program in Web Development! I've designed and crafted a sleek landing page for sunglasses using CSS and HTML, utilizing Visual Studio Code as my development environment. This experience has been invaluable, pushing me to enhance my skills and create a user-friendly web interface.
